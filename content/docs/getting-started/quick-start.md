During a human genetics and precision medicine lecture it was stated approximately 50% of SSRI's are ineffective in the treatment of depression in patients due to pharmacogenetic factors. The misdiagnosis of therapuetic medications can be avoided with correct prior screening of patients using newly developed technologies. Current technologies allow for the genetic screening of individuals but the technology is rarely used in a common clincal setting, after learning about the possibilty to prevent misdiagnosis using genetic data a decision was made to create medicamina, an application which will allow indivduals to carry around their vital genetic, previous diagnostic, and family history information. Medicamina's goal was to move the center of information from the physicians cabinet to the patients pocket and for the patinet to be able to grant a doctor access to information while also being able to intrepret the data themselves. A model was designed in which the individual will get a genetic test and have the results sent to their devices, then this information can be used at every consultation to prevent misdiagnosis at any clinic.- Founded a startup dedicated to changing the practice of medicine from traditional methods of prescription to a precision medicine approach using whole genome sequencing and databases preventing pharmacogenetic misdiagnosis - Developing a cross-platform application using Flutter, SQL and material design in the dart programming language available on desktop, mobile and watchOS for seamless client-consultant information flow - Advancing with the view to study a Medicine Doctorate and a Master of Medicine (in Genomics and Precision Medicine) at the end of my robotics degree During a human genetics and precision medicine class a lecture was given in which it was stated approximately 50% of SSRI's are ineffective in the treatment of depression in patients due to pharmacogenetic factors.

<!-- 
## Requirements

Before using the theme, you need to install the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) â‰¥ 0.15.0.

## Run the Theme Directly

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaranxu/adidoks.git
cd adidoks
zola serve
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:1111/` in the browser.

## Installation

Just earlier we showed you how to run the theme directly. Now we start to
install the theme in an existing site step by step.

### Step 1: Create a new zola site

```bash
zola init mysite
```

### Step 2: Install AdiDoks

Download this theme to your themes directory:

```bash
cd mysite/themes
git clone https://github.com/aaranxu/adidoks.git
```

Or install as a submodule:

```bash
cd mysite
git init  # if your project is a git repository already, ignore this command
git submodule add https://github.com/aaranxu/adidoks.git themes/adidoks
```

### Step 3: Configuration

Enable the theme in your `config.toml` in the site derectory:

```toml
theme = "adidoks"
```

Or copy the `config.toml.example` from the theme directory to your project's
root directory:

```bash
cp themes/adidoks/config.toml.example config.toml
```

### Step 4: Add new content

You can copy the content from the theme directory to your project:

```bash
cp -r themes/adidoks/content .
```

You can modify or add new posts in the `content/blog`, `content/docs` or other
content directories as needed.

### Step 5: Run the project

Just run `zola serve` in the root path of the project:

```bash
zola serve
```

AdiDoks will start the Zola development web server accessible by default at 
`http://127.0.0.1:1111`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser. -->
